# Example for extracting a list of items from data augmented into a prompt.
# 2023.08.13 Observations: 
# GPT* pays most attention to the variable name, followed by the prompt, followed by the var descriptions. 
# The description is almost pointless.
# GPT4 takes the prompt more literally and hesitates to use its world knowledge.
# It might also matter what the function is called - with extract_data, it might hesitate to use world knowledge.
