Below are different answers to the following question:
"<%= question # this will insert the question passed in to the erb template
%>"

<% 
# iterate over the answers we want to rate so that they will all be in the prompt
answers.each_pair do |model, answer| 
%>
<%= model %>'s response: <%= answer.completion %>
<% end %>

<% 
# now we will instruct the LLM to rate each of the answers: 
%>
Write a brief critique of each answer. 

Then, generate a string in json format with a rating (0..1) for each answer.

Enclose the string in XML tags, like this:
&lt;ratings&gt;
<%=
JSON.pretty_generate(answers.map { |model,_| [model, "rating for the answer from #{model}"]}.to_h)
%>
&lt;/ratings&gt;
