I am designing a metaprompt for generating files in a certain way.
I tried the metaprompt I am calling "<%= try %>" on several tests and with different LLMs.

The output log is here:

<log>
<%= fail_info %>
</log>

List the failures and successes, count how many failures there were, how many successes, and how many attempts in total.

Briefly describe each instance where an LLM failed to produce the desired output, explaining what the LLM produced and how it differed from the baseline.

Summarize how well the metaprompt performed, and calculate the percentage of failures.
